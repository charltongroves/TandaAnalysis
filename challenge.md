Data Science
=================================

This task is a challenge for data scientists, business analysts or anyone with an interest in statistics.  

At Tanda, one thing we definitely donâ€™t have a shortage of is data and we love to use this data wherever possible.  Currently we are looking at redesigning and simplifying how the settings in Tanda are presented, with the aim of improving the configuration process for users and we want to use data to drive the decisions we make when doing so.  

Your challenge is to analyse some sample settings configuration data and suggest how this could best be done.  

This challenge should take no more than two hours to complete.  

## Setting up

You have been provided two files: *Tanda Settings Info.csv* and *Tanda Organisation Settings.csv*.

*Tanda Settings Info.csv* contains information about each of the configurable settings in Tanda.  The name of the setting, the default which is set on account creation, the type of data and whether it is an explicit (obvious effect) or implicit (not obvious effect) setting.  

*Tanda Organisation Settings.csv* contains a sample of settings configurations.  The column headers should map to each of the settings rows provided in *Tanda Settings Info.csv*.  

You may use any programming language you desire for this challenge, and we strongly suggest that you submit any code written.  

## The Challenge

Investigate and present the following in whichever format you think is most appropriate:

* The percentage of users which change each setting.  
* The distribution of users that change > x% of settings overall.  
* The difference in configuration between explicit and implicit settings (we theorize the explicit settings are more likely to be set by users)
* A general method for determining the user space which will be affected should a setting (or set of settings) be removed/hidden.  
* Existing settings are visible for editing at https://my.tanda.co/settings (you can sign up for a [free trial](https://my.tanda.co/try) to see it). Make a recommendation on structural improvements to the page based on your findings.

## Submitting Your Answer
